# Facial-Expression-Recognition
DETECTING EMOTION FROM FACIAL EXPRESSION HAS BECOME AN URGENT NEED BECAUSE OF ITS IMMENSE APPLICATIONS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SUCH AS HUMAN-COMPUTER COLLABORATION, DATA DRIVEN ANIMATION, HUMAN-ROBOT COMMUNICATION ETC. SINCE IT IS A DEMANDING AND INTERESTING PROBLEM IN COMPUTER VISION, SEVERAL WORKS HAD BEEN CONDUCTED REGARDING THIS TOPIC. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION SYSTEM BASED ON CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK WITH DATA AUGMENTATION. THIS APPROACH ENABLES TO CLASSIFY SEVEN BASIC EMOTIONS CONSIST OF ANGRY, DISGUST, FEAR, HAPPY, NEUTRAL, SAD AND SURPRISE FROM IMAGE DATA. CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK WITH DATA AUGMENTATION LEADS TO HIGHER VALIDATION ACCURACY THAN THE OTHER EXISTING MODELS (WHICH IS 96.24%) AS WELL AS HELPS TO OVERCOME THEIR LIMITATIONS.

- This is a great project.
